                    <h4>Gabriel meets Mary</h4>
                    <small>Luke 1: 26 - 38</small>
                    <p>
                        26 In the sixth month of Elizabeth‚Äôs pregnancy, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a town in Galilee, 
                        27 to a virgin pledged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. The virgin‚Äôs name was Mary. 
                        28 The angel went to her and said, ‚ÄúGreetings, you who are highly favored! The Lord is with you.‚Äù
                        29 Mary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be. 
                        30 But the angel said to her, ‚ÄúDo not be afraid, Mary; you have found favor with God. 
                        31 You will conceive and give birth to a son, and you are to call him Jesus. 
                        32 He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David, 
                        33 and he will reign over Jacob‚Äôs descendants forever; his kingdom will never end.‚Äù
                        34 ‚ÄúHow will this be,‚Äù Mary asked the angel, ‚Äúsince I am a virgin?‚Äù
                        35 The angel answered, ‚ÄúThe Holy Spirit will come on you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the holy one to be born will be called[a] the Son of God. 
                        36 Even Elizabeth your relative is going to have a child in her old age, and she who was said to be unable to conceive is in her sixth month. 
                        37 For no word from God will ever fail.‚Äù
                        38 ‚ÄúI am the Lord‚Äôs servant,‚Äù Mary answered. ‚ÄúMay your word to me be fulfilled.‚Äù Then the angel left her.

                    <h4>Mary Visits Elizabeth</h4>
                    <small>Luke 1: 39 - 56</small>
                    <p>
                        39 At that time Mary got ready and hurried to a town in the hill country of Judea, 
                        40 where she entered Zechariah‚Äôs home and greeted Elizabeth. 
                        41 When Elizabeth heard Mary‚Äôs greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. 
                        42 In a loud voice she exclaimed: ‚ÄúBlessed are you among women, and blessed is the child you will bear! 
                        43 But why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? 
                        44 As soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy. 
                        45 Blessed is she who has believed that the Lord would fulfill his promises to her!‚Äù
                        
                        46 And Mary said:

                        ‚ÄúMy soul glorifies the Lord
                        47     and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,
                        48 for he has been mindful
                            of the humble state of his servant.
                        From now on all generations will call me blessed,
                        49     for the Mighty One has done great things for me‚Äî
                            holy is his name.
                        50 His mercy extends to those who fear him,
                            from generation to generation.
                        51 He has performed mighty deeds with his arm;
                            he has scattered those who are proud in their inmost thoughts.
                        52 He has brought down rulers from their thrones
                           but has lifted up the humble.
                        53 He has filled the hungry with good things
                            but has sent the rich away empty.
                        54 He has helped his servant Israel,
                            remembering to be merciful
                        55 to Abraham and his descendants forever,
                            just as he promised our ancestors.‚Äù

                        56 Mary stayed with Elizabeth for about three months and then returned home.

                    <h4>Joseph's Dream</h4>
                    <small>Matthew 1: 18 - 25</small>
                    <p>
                        18 This is how the birth of Jesus the Messiah came about[a]: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be pregnant through the Holy Spirit. 
                        19 Because Joseph her husband was faithful to the law, and yet[b] did not want to expose her to public disgrace, he had in mind to divorce her quietly.
                        20 But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, ‚ÄúJoseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. 
                        21 She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus,[c] because he will save his people from their sins.‚Äù
                        22 All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet: 
                        23 ‚ÄúThe virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel‚Äù[d] (which means ‚ÄúGod with us‚Äù).
                        24 When Joseph woke up, he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took Mary home as his wife. 25 But he did not consummate their marriage until she gave birth to a son. And he gave him the name Jesus.

                    <h4>Christ is Born</h4>
                    <small>Luke 2: 1 - 7</small>
                    <p>
                        1 In those days Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world. 
                        2 (This was the first census that took place while[a] Quirinius was governor of Syria.) 
                        3 And everyone went to their own town to register.
                        4 So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to Bethlehem the town of David, because he belonged to the house and line of David. 
                        5 He went there to register with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a child. 
                        6 While they were there, the time came for the baby to be born, 
                        7 and she gave birth to her firstborn, a son. She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger, because there was no guest room available for them.

                    <h4>The Shepherds</h4>
                    <small>Luke 2: 8 - 20</small>
                    <p>
                        8 And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night. 
                        9 An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. 
                        10 But the angel said to them, ‚ÄúDo not be afraid. I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all the people. 
                        11 Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is the Messiah, the Lord. 
                        12 This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.‚Äù
                        13 Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and saying,
                        14 ‚ÄúGlory to God in the highest heaven,
                            and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests.‚Äù
                        15 When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about.‚Äù
                        16 So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby, who was lying in the manger. 17 When they had seen him, they spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child, 18 and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them. 19 But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart. 20 The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen, which were just as they had been told.

                    <h4>The Three Wise Men</h4>
                    <small>Matthew 2: 1 - 12</small>
                    <p>
                        1 After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the time of King Herod, Magi from the east came to Jerusalem 
                        2 and asked, ‚ÄúWhere is the one who has been born king of the Jews? We saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him.‚Äù
                        3 When King Herod heard this he was disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him. 
                        4 When he had called together all the people‚Äôs chief priests and teachers of the law, he asked them where the Messiah was to be born. 
                        5 ‚ÄúIn Bethlehem in Judea,‚Äù they replied, ‚Äúfor this is what the prophet has written:
                        6 ‚Äú‚ÄòBut you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah,
                            are by no means least among the rulers of Judah;
                            for out of you will come a ruler
                            who will shepherd my people Israel.‚Äô‚Äù
                        7 Then Herod called the Magi secretly and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared. 
                        8 He sent them to Bethlehem and said, ‚ÄúGo and search carefully for the child. As soon as you find him, report to me, so that I too may go and worship him.‚Äù
                        9 After they had heard the king, they went on their way, and the star they had seen when it rose went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was. 10 When they saw the star, they were overjoyed. 11 On coming to the house, they saw the child with his mother Mary, and they bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh. 12 And having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, they returned to their country by another route.

                    <p>
                        13 When they had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream. ‚ÄúGet up,‚Äù he said, ‚Äútake the child and his mother and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him.‚Äù
                        14 So he got up, took the child and his mother during the night and left for Egypt, 
                        15 where he stayed until the death of Herod. And so was fulfilled what the Lord had said through the prophet: ‚ÄúOut of Egypt I called my son.‚Äù
                        16 When Herod realized that he had been outwitted by the Magi, he was furious, and he gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under, in accordance with the time he had learned from the Magi. 
                        17 Then what was said through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:
                        18 ‚ÄúA voice is heard in Ramah,
                            weeping and great mourning,
                            Rachel weeping for her children
                            and refusing to be comforted,
                            because they are no more.‚Äù
